# Requirements

## Introduction

Every year the employees of the country should pay their income tax to the Income tax Department. Most of the employees of our country don't know how the taxes are being imposed and calculated according to section 80 and its sub-sections. If they know but it is time taking to  figure out all those tax deductions and income tax percentages being calculated. So a simple application that takes the income details and expenditure details(expenditure details which are particularly used to figure out deductions according to section 80(C)-80(RRB)) and calculate taxes for those input details and generates a report of all that stuff would be helpful.
